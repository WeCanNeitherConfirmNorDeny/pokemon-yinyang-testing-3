# pokemon-yinyang-testing-3

pokemon yin/yang (working title)

a simple hack based on the red++ project (check it out at "https://github.com/thefakemateo/rpp-backup")

some features:

  * genders have their own stat added to the various '\_struct' macros (the effect is IV strength isn't determinged by sex)
  * god items and mythic berries
  * a new berry :) the gold berry (makes your pokemon shiny)
  * the ocean berry (gives your pokemon evs)
  * enchanted mirror (fly map ins your pocket)
  * snowglobe (randomly makes next wild shiny)
  * better and shorter intro
  * minor fixes


to install and build:
 * download the master zip at the Red++ project ("https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/rpp-backup/archive/refs/heads/master.zip")
 * as well as the files in the extras
 * download the rgbds assembler tools
 * cygwin for make, python 2.7 bash or linux
 * make a folder for the red++ files and then copy my files over it
 * run make

ideas/todo:
* easy mode will be easy
* hard mode will be impossible
* disable/remove all the music (maybe all the sound, i dont use it)
* quests n shiii
