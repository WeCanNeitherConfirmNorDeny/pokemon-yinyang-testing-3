# pokemon-yinyang-testing-3

pokemon yin/yang (working title)
a simple hack based on the red++ project (check it out at "https://github.com/thefakemateo/rpp-backup")

some features:
  * genders have their own stat added to the various '\_struct' macros (the effect is IV strength isn't determinged by sex)
  * a new berry :) the gold berry (makes your pokemon shiny)
